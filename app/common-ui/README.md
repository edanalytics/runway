# common-ui

This library contains generic UI components and the theme. It's intended to be shareable between any apps forked from this repo, but that will go out the window if an app requires non-themeable modifications which would be too bad but sometimes expected.

Most of the components here are configured for Storybook. Run it like this:

```sh
npm run common-ui:storybook
```
